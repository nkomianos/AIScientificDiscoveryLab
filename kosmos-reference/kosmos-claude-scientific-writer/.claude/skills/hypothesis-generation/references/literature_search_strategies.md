# Literature Search Strategies

Comprehensive literature search grounds hypotheses in existing evidence. This reference provides efficient strategies for PubMed (biomedical) and general scientific search.

## Search Strategy Framework

### Three-Phase Approach

1. **Broad exploration:** Understand the landscape, identify key concepts
2. **Focused searching:** Target specific mechanisms, theories, findings
3. **Citation mining:** Follow references from key papers

### Before Searching

Clarify: What evidence is needed? What study types are relevant? What time frame? What evidence level (mechanistic, correlational, causal)?

## PubMed Search Strategies

**Use PubMed for:** Biomedical/life sciences, clinical studies, molecular/cellular mechanisms, disease etiology, drug research.

### Key Techniques

**1. Start with Reviews**
- Add "review" to search terms or use Article Type filters
- Reviews synthesize literature and provide comprehensive reference lists
- Example: `https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=wound+healing+diabetes+review`

**2. Use MeSH Terms**
- Standardized vocabulary captures concept variations
- "Myocardial Infarction" finds "heart attack," "MI," "cardiac infarction"

**3. Boolean Operators**
- **AND:** All terms required (`diabetes AND wound healing AND inflammation`)
- **OR:** Any term (`(Alzheimer OR dementia) AND gut microbiome`)
- **NOT:** Exclude (`cancer treatment NOT surgery`)
- **Quotes:** Exact phrases (`"oxidative stress"`)
- **Wildcards:** `gene*` finds gene, genes, genetic, genetics

**4. Filters**
- Publication types: Clinical Trial, Meta-Analysis, Systematic Review, RCT
- Date ranges: Recent (2-5 years) for cutting-edge, older for foundational

**5. Similar Articles and Cited By**
- Find one relevant paper, use "Similar articles" for related work
- "Cited by" finds newer work building on it

### PubMed Search Patterns

| Goal | Search Pattern |
|------|----------------|
| Mechanistic | `(mechanism OR pathway) AND [phenomenon] AND (molecular OR cellular)` |
| Causal | `[exposure] AND [outcome] AND (randomized controlled trial OR cohort study)` |
| Biomarkers | `[biomarker] AND [disease] AND (association OR correlation OR prediction)` |
| Treatment | `[intervention] AND [condition] AND (efficacy OR effectiveness OR clinical trial)` |

## Web Search Strategies

**Use web search for:** Non-biomedical sciences, interdisciplinary topics, preprints, grey literature, cross-domain analogies.

### Key Techniques

**1. Target Academic Sources**
- `site:arxiv.org` (physics, CS, math, quantitative biology)
- `site:biorxiv.org` (biology preprints)
- `site:edu` (academic institutions)
- `filetype:pdf` (academic papers)

**2. Domain-Specific Terms**
- Chemistry: "mechanism," "reaction pathway," "synthesis"
- Physics: "model," "theory," "experimental validation"
- Materials: "properties," "characterization"
- Ecology: "population dynamics," "community structure"

**3. Boolean Logic**
- Use quotes for exact phrases: `"spike protein mutation"`
- Use OR for alternatives: `(transmissibility OR transmission rate)`
- Combine: `"spike protein" AND (transmissibility OR virulence) AND mutation`

**4. Author/Lab Searches**
- Find relevant paper → search author's other work → find lab website

## Comprehensive Search Workflow

1. **Reviews first:** Identify key concepts, influential papers, current state
2. **Focused primary research:** Specific mechanisms, experimental evidence
3. **Broaden with web search:** Related fields, preprints, analogies
4. **Citation mining:** Follow references, use "cited by"
5. **Iterate:** Add new terms, narrow/broaden as needed

## Evaluating Source Quality

### Primary Research Quality

| Strong Signals | Red Flags |
|----------------|-----------|
| Reputable journals | No peer review |
| Large sample sizes | Undisclosed conflicts |
| Pre-registered studies | Unclear methods |
| Appropriate controls | Extraordinary claims without evidence |
| Transparent data | Contradicts established evidence |

### Review Quality

- **Systematic reviews (highest):** Pre-defined search, explicit criteria, quality assessment, meta-analysis
- **Narrative reviews (variable):** Expert synthesis, may have selection bias, useful for context

## Time Allocation

| Hypothesis Type | Time | Scope |
|-----------------|------|-------|
| Straightforward | 30-60 min | 1-2 reviews, 3-5 primary papers |
| Complex | 1-3 hours | Multiple reviews, 10-15 primary papers |
| Contentious | 3+ hours | Systematic approach, competing perspectives |

### Diminishing Returns

**Stop when:** Finding same papers repeatedly, new searches yield irrelevant papers, sufficient evidence gathered, multiple lines converge.

**Search more when:** Major gaps remain, conflicting evidence unresolved, hypothesis inconsistent with literature.

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Confirmation bias** | Actively search for contradicting evidence |
| **Recency bias** | Include historical searches, track idea development |
| **Too narrow** | Use OR operators, try alternative terminology |
| **Too broad** | Add specific terms, use filters, combine with AND |
| **Single database** | Search both PubMed and web, try domain-specific databases |
| **Stopping too soon** | Set minimums: 2 reviews + 5 primary papers per aspect |
| **Cherry-picking** | Represent full evidence spectrum, acknowledge contradictions |

## Special Cases

**Emerging topics (limited literature):**
- Search analogous phenomena in related systems
- Look for preprints and conference abstracts
- Note limited evidence in hypothesis generation

**Controversial topics (conflicting literature):**
- Document both sides systematically
- Look for methodological differences explaining conflict
- Generate hypotheses explaining discrepancies

**Interdisciplinary topics:**
- Search each field's databases with field-specific terminology
- Look for bridging papers citing across fields

## Integration with Hypothesis Generation

**Literature informs hypotheses through:**
- Established mechanisms to apply to new contexts
- Known pathways relevant to phenomenon
- Analogies from different systems
- Gaps suggesting novel mechanisms

**Balance literature dependence:**
- Too dependent: Hypotheses merely restate known facts
- Too independent: Hypotheses ignore relevant evidence
- Optimal: Grounded in evidence, extend understanding in novel ways, generate testable predictions
